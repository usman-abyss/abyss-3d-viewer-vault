This file contains a single function that is responsible for handling the 'animation' that is created is some examples of Abyss 3D Viewer. 

Let's break down the code and understand what each part does:

1. The `startAnimation` function is a higher-order function that creates and returns an `AnimationPlayer` object based on the provided `animation` and other parameters.

2. The function starts by mapping each step of the animation (defined in `animation.steps`) to create an array of animation steps. Each step is represented by a specific class: `CameraMovementAnimationStep` for camera movements and `PauseAnimationStep` for pauses.

3. For each step, the function checks its `type` property (e.g., `moveCamera` or `pause`) and creates the corresponding animation step object. If the `type` is `moveCamera`, it creates a `CameraMovementAnimationStep` with the specified `cameraPosition` and `cameraLookAt` properties, using the provided `cameraMover`. If the `type` is 'pause', it creates a `PauseAnimationStep` with the specified `time` property.

4. If an invalid step type is encountered, the function throws an error indicating the invalid step type and the name of the animation it occurred in.

5. After creating all the animation steps, the function creates a new `AnimationPlayer` object, passing the array of animation steps and the `onComplete` callback to the constructor.

6. Finally, the function returns the newly created `AnimationPlayer`.

The purpose of this code is to enable the creation of animation sequences with camera movements and pauses. It uses the provided `CameraMover` to control the camera movements and executes the provided `onComplete` function when the animation sequence is finished. The animation steps and their parameters are defined in the `animation` object.
