This file defines a React component called `TextLabel`, which is used to render a 3D text label in a Three.js scene. Let's break down the code and go in-depth on the `useFrame` hook usage.

1. `TextLabelProps` interface: This defines the props that can be passed to the `TextLabel` component. It includes properties like `position`, `text`, `color`, `fontSize`, `font`,  `fillOpacity`, `strokeWidth`, `strokeColor`, and `strokeOpacity`.

2. `TextLabel` component: This functional component takes the props defined in `TextLabelProps` and renders a 3D text label at the specified `position` in the scene. It uses the `useFrame` hook to perform actions on every frame update.

3. `useFrame` hook: This is a custom hook provided by `@react-three/fiber` that allows performing actions on each frame update, similar to the `requestAnimationFrame` loop in Three.js. The hook takes a callback function that receives an object containing information about the `camera` and the `gl` (WebGL) renderer.

Inside the `useFrame` callback, the following steps are performed:

- A `scale` variable is initialized to 1, which will be used to scale the text label based on its distance from the camera.
- If `group.current` (the 3D group that holds the text) exists, it calculates the appropriate `scale` based on the camera's perspective and position.

- If the camera is an `OrthographicCamera`, the scale is adjusted based on the camera's `zoom` property.

- If the camera is a `PerspectiveCamera`, the scale is adjusted based on the distance between the camera and the text's position. It calculates the size of the text on the screen based on the camera's field of view (fov) and its distance from the text. This ensures that the text scales with the distance from the camera, appearing smaller when farther away and larger when closer.

- The `group.current`'s scale is set using the calculated `scale` value, effectively scaling the text as necessary based on the camera's perspective.

- The `group.current`'s quaternion (orientation) is set to match the camera's quaternion. This ensures that the text always faces the camera, giving the appearance of a 2D text label even though it's in a 3D scene.

Finally, the `TextLabel` component returns a `<group>` element (a Three.js concept used to group objects) with a `ref` to the `group` variable. Inside this group, a `Suspense` component is used to handle loading states for the `Text` component from `@react-three/drei`.

- The `Text` component renders the actual 3D text with the specified properties like `anchorX`, `anchorY`, `font`, `fontSize`, `color`, `fillOpacity`, `strokeWidth`, `strokeColor`, and `strokeOpacity`. The `text` prop passed to `Text` is the actual text content to be displayed.

In summary, the `TextLabel` component renders a 3D text label that automatically scales and faces the camera based on its distance and the camera's perspective, thanks to the calculations performed in the `useFrame` hook. This provides a convenient way to create interactive and dynamic 3D text labels in a Three.js scene using React.
