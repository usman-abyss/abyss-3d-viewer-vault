1. **identityMatrix4**: This is a constant that represents a [4x4 identity matrix](../types), which is used as a default transformation matrix.

2. **disposeMaterials**: This function takes a single `THREE.Material` or an array of `THREE.Material`s and disposes of them. It helps with cleaning up [material](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/Material) objects, which is important to avoid memory leaks in Three.js.

3. **positionRotationFromMatrix4**: This function takes a 4x4 transformation matrix and returns the position and rotation vectors (as `Vector3`) extracted from it. It uses Three.js to perform the matrix calculations.

4. **alignModelByTwoVectors**: This function aligns a model's transformation matrix based on two given vectors, `fromDirection` and `toDirection`. It creates a quaternion rotation to achieve the alignment and applies it to the input transformation matrix.

5. **alignModelByTwoPoints**: This function aligns a model's transformation matrix based on two given points, `a` and `b`, in 3D space. It computes the direction vector between the points and aligns the model to match this direction.

6. **computeBoundingBox**: This function computes the bounding box (min and max coordinates) of a `THREE.Object3D` (a 3D object in Three.js). It involves cloning the object, updating its matrix world, and computing the bounding box for its geometry.

7. **renderReactElementToString**: This function takes a React element and renders it into a temporary HTML div element using React's `createRoot` and `flushSync`. It then returns the resulting HTML content as a string. This function can be used to convert a React component to an HTML string, which can be useful for server-side rendering or generating HTML for static sites.
